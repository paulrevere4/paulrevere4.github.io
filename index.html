	<!-- Title -->
	<h1>Paul Revere, IV</h1>

	<!-- Intro, contact, and resume -->
	<p>Hi, I&#39;m Paul. I study computer science at RPI, an engineering school in upstate New York. If you are interested in my work please take a look at my <a href="PaulRevereResume.pdf">resume</a> or my <a href="https://github.com/paulrevere4">github</a>. The easiest way to reach me is to email me at <a href="mailto:me@paulrevere4.com">me@paulrevere4.com</a> or by downloading my <a href="contact.vcf">contact card</a>. You can also connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulrevere4">linkedin</a>.</p>

	<!-- Interests, skills, and courses -->
	<p>I&#39;m a software engineer focused on the systems that can scale to make computationally intensive tasks feasible. My languages of choice are Java, C/C++, and Python and I&#39;m a proud Linux user (I also have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Linux">the same birthday as Linux</a>). In school I have taken courses in the fundamentals like Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems, Programming Languages, and Software Design. I have also enjoyed classes in Distributed Systems, Theoretical Distributed Computing, Machine Learning, Data Mining, Artificial Intelligence, and Cryptography.</p>

	<!-- Quantcast Work -->
	<p>For the summer of 2016 I interned with <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/">Quantcast</a> in San Francisco, CA where I was a part of their Big Data Services team. I worked on a Java project that allows data scientists and analysts run SQL-like queries over petabytes of data through MapReduce jobs. Think like <a href="https://prestodb.io/">Presto</a> or <a href="https://hive.apache.org/">Hive</a> but tailored for their systems and use cases. On this project I made changes to add <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-predicate-pushdown-In-mapreduce">predicate pushdown</a> capabilities to reads from databases, speeding up reads by 10x in some cases and reducing network traffic in their datacenters. I also re-implemented the <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jignesh/publ/hadoopjoin.pdf#page=4">broadcast-join</a> operation, allowing for more flexibility in its usage.</p>

	<!-- SCOREC Work -->
	<p>Last year I was an undergraduate researcher for RPI's Scientific Computation Research Center (<a href="http://www.scorec.rpi.edu/">SCOREC</a>) working on PUMI, a C/C++ project for the U.S. Department of Energy's <a href="http://www.fastmath-scidac.org/">FASTMathSciDAC Institute</a>. PUMI, the Parallel Unstructured Mesh Infrastructure, is an infrastructure on which large-scale finite element analysis projects can be created. The project has tremendous demands for scalability, having been scaled to run with <a href="https://vimeo.com/120504264">256K processes</a> communicating over MPI. I worked on a library called <a href="http://www.fastmath-scidac.org/research/attached-parallel-fields.html">Attached Parallel Fields</a> where I implemented a simple binary encoding scheme along with compression for mesh visualization files that led to a 3x reduction in their size. I also accommodated for issues that arise when writing files in massively parallel environments with thousands of CPUs. My work can be seen on the project's <a href="https://github.com/SCOREC/core">github</a> page.</p>

	<!-- KAPL Work -->
	<p>During the summer of 2015 I was a technical intern at the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory in Niskayuna, NY. Knolls is a laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy specializing in the design of nuclear reactors for the U.S. Navy. I worked on a Java project that statistically sampled nuclear data to create a representative input for a larger physics simulation. I was able to reduce the run time and memory usage of the project by orders of magnitude from what the original design of the project would have used, doing so by cutting out redundant calculations.</p>
