	<!-- Title -->
	<h1>Paul Revere, IV</h1>

	<!-- Intro, contact, and resume -->
	<p>Hi, I&#39;m Paul. I study computer science at RPI, an engineering school in upstate New York. If you are interested in my work please take a look at my <a href="PaulRevereResume.pdf">resume</a> or my <a href="https://github.com/paulrevere4">github</a>. The easiest way to reach me is to email me at <a href="mailto:me@paulrevere4.com">me@paulrevere4.com</a> or by downloading my <a href="contact.vcf">contact card</a>. You can also connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulrevere4">linkedin</a>.</p>

	<!-- Interests, skills, and courses -->
	<p>I&#39;m a software engineer interested in the infrastructure that systems with high demands of scalability and efficiency are built on. I&#39;m a proud linux user and my languages of choice are Java, C/C++, and Python. In school I have taken courses in the fundamentals like Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems, Programming Languages, and Software Design and I have enjoyed special topics classes like Dsitributed Systems, Theoretical Distributed Computing, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Cryptography.</p>

	<!-- Quantcast Work -->
	<p>Currently I am an intern at <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/">Quantcast</a> in San Francisco, CA where I am a part of their Big Data Services team. I work on a Java project that allows our data scientists and analysts run SQL-like queries over petabytes of data through MapReduce jobs. Think like <a href="https://prestodb.io/">Presto</a> or <a href="https://hive.apache.org/">Hive</a> but tailored for our systems and use cases. On this project I made changes to add <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-predicate-pushdown-In-mapreduce">predicate pushdown</a> capabilities to reads from our databases, speeding up the map procedures of our jobs by 10x in some cases and reducing network traffic in our datacenters. I also re-implemented our <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jignesh/publ/hadoopjoin.pdf#page=4">broadcast-join</a> operation, allowing for more flexibility in its usage.</p>

	<!-- SCOREC Work -->
	<p>For the previous school year I have been an undergraduate researcher for RPI's Scientific Computation Research Center (<a href="http://www.scorec.rpi.edu/">SCOREC</a>) working on PUMI, a C/C++ project for the U.S. Department of Energy's <a href="http://www.fastmath-scidac.org/">FASTMathSciDAC Institute</a>. PUMI, the Parallel Unstructured Mesh Infrastructure, is an infrastructure on which large-scale finite element analysis projects can be created. The project has tremendous demands for scalability, having been scaled to run with <a href="https://vimeo.com/120504264">256K processes</a> communicating over MPI. I worked on a library called <a href="http://www.fastmath-scidac.org/research/attached-parallel-fields.html">Attached Parallel Fields</a> where I implemented a simple binary encoding scheme along with compression for mesh visualization files that led to a 3x reduction in their size. I also accommodated for issues that arise when writing files in massively parallel environments with thousands of CPUs. My work can be seen on the project's <a href="https://github.com/SCOREC/core">github</a> page.</p>

	<!-- KAPL Work -->
	<p>During the summer of 2015 I was a technical intern at the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory in Niskayuna, NY. Knolls is a laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy specializing in the design of nuclear reactors for the U.S. Navy. I worked on a Java project that statistically sampled nuclear data to create a representative input for a larger physics simulation. I was able to reduce the run time and memory usage of the project by orders of magnitude from what the original design of the project would have used, doing so by cutting out redundant calculations.</p>
